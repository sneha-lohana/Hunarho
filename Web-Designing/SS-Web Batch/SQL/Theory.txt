What is Data?
Information is stored in form of 
1. Text
2. Numbers
3. Images
4. Videos
5. Documents - docx, excel, txt, csv

History of Database
1. Text files - Flat Database
2. Structured Database - Excel
        Data Repeatition - Data Redundancy
3. Relational Database

Relational Database Management System - MySQL

Rules:
Edgar F. Codd
14 EF Codd Rules

1. Relation - Table
2. Attribute - Column Names (Homogeneous - similar data)
3. Tuple - a row in table or record in relation
4. Relationship
    -> One to One - Aadhar Card, PAN Card, Passport
    -> One to Many - Bank Account, Courses, Gmail Account, Degrees
    -> Many to Many - Course to Teacher, Teacher to Student, Teacher to Classes
5. Keys
    -> Simple Key - a single Attribute
    -> Composite Key - when two or more columns are combined to create a key.
    -> Candidate Key - any column that is proposed to be a primary key is called as candidate key.
        => Unique 
        => It can't be null (empty)
    -> Primary Key - is a unique identifier of a tuple.
    -> Unique Key - no value can be repeated but it can have null (empty) value.
    -> Foreign Key - any column that allows me to create a relationship between two tables.
    -> Semantic or Natural Key
        Maharashtra MH
        Gujurat GJ
    -> Technical or Surrogate or Artifical Key - When a table doesn't have any columns that can be identified as primary another unique column is added for the same purpose

SQL - Structured Query Language
SEQUEL
1. Retrieving Data
2. Insert, Update, Delete Data
3. Create, Modify, Drop and Truncate tables and databases
4. Grant access 

Types of SQL Statements:
1. DDL - Data Definition Language
Create, Modify or Delete the schema of the Database, - Database, Tables, View, Indexes etc

CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE

2. DML - Data Manipulation Language
Allows to modify information or data inside the table
INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

3. DQL - Data Query Language
SELECT, SHOW

4. DCL / TCL - Data Control Language / Transaction Control Language
GRANT, REVOKE
COMMIT, REVOKE, SAVEPOINT

1. SQL is not case sensitive
2. End every query with a semicolon ;
3. Error reading is difficult

********************** MySQL Command*************************
Installation is done properly
